ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syn-\\ndrome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up one\\nof the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail-\\nure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose\\nlungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is a\\ntrue medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdown\\nof the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluid\\nfrom leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lung\\ninto the breathing sacs (the alveoli).\\nDescription\\nAnother name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal\\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,\\nmay be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,\\nor capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacs\\nat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).\\nThis is the all-important site where oxygen passes from\\nair that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all parts\\nof the body.

Any form of lung injury that damages this\\npoint of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,\\nwill allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,\\neventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The result\\nis the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS is\\none of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, the\\nother being heart failure.\\nAlong with fluid there is a marked increase in\\ninflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left over\\nfrom damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-solid materi-\\nal derived from blood in the tissues. Typically these\\nmaterials join together with large molecules in the blood\\n(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-\\nbranes are very prominent in premature infants who\\ndevelop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often called\\nhyaline membrane disease.)

Allergy is the single largest\\nreason for school absence and is a major source of lost\\nproductivity in the workplace.\\nAn allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,\\nthe immune system responds to foreign microorganisms\\nor particles by producing specific proteins called anti-\\nbodies. These antibodies are capable of binding to iden-\\ntifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign particle.\\nThis reaction between antibody and antigen sets off a\\nseries of chemical reactions designed to protect the\\nbody from infection. Sometimes, this same series of\\nreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances\\nsuch as pollen, dust, and animal danders.

It is also known as\\nmotor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease, after the\\nbaseball player whose career it ended.\\nDescription\\nALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nerve\\ncells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (upper\\nmotor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheral\\nnerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle move-\\nment. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these neurons die,\\nleading to a progressive loss of the ability to move virtual-\\nly any of the muscles in the body. ALS affects “volun-'),\n",

ALS affects “volun-\\ntary” muscles, those controlled by conscious thought,\\nsuch as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and of\\nitself, does not affect sensation, thought processes, the\\nheart muscle, or the “smooth” muscle of the digestive sys-\\ntem, bladder, and other internal organs. Most people with\\nALS retain function of their eye muscles as well. Howev-\\ner, various forms of ALS may be associated with a loss of\\nintellectual function (dementia) or sensory symptoms.\\n“Amyotrophic” refers to the loss of muscle bulk, a\\ncardinal sign of ALS. “Lateral” indicates one of the\\nregions of the spinal cord affected, and “sclerosis”\\ndescribes the hardened tissue that develops in place of\\nhealthy nerves. ALS affects approximately 30,000 people\\nin the United States, with about 5,000 new cases each\\nyear. It usually begins between the ages of 40 and 70,\\nalthough younger onset is possible.

Normally, these\\nneurons convey electrical messages from the brain to the\\nmuscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk,\\nneck, and head. As motor neurons die, the muscles they\\nenervate cannot be moved as effectively, and weakness\\nresults. In addition, lack of stimulation leads to muscle\\nwasting, or loss of bulk.
